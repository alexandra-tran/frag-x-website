    <p>This page lays out the specification for commands in frag-x</p>
    <h2>The basics</h2>
    <p>When sending a message there are two different types, the first is a normal message, this is the kind of message you want other players in the game to see. The other type of message is one that is a command, these are run to change something about the game.</p>
    <p>When sending commands there are two different types of commands, there are client commands and server commands. To run a client command you must prefix your command like so: <code>-c &lt;command&gt;</code>, similarly for server commands you just do <code>-s &lt;command&gt;</code> </p>
    <h2>client commands</h2>
    <table style="width:100%">

        <th>command</th>
        <th>what it does</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>/sens &lt;NUMBER&gt;</code></td>
        <td>changes your sensitivity to <code>&lt;NUMBER&gt;</code></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <h2>server commands</h2>
